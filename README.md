📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to measure the distance of an object using an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04) with a Raspberry Pi.

The system continuously calculates and prints the distance to the nearest object in meters.

This project is useful for:

Obstacle detection systems

Robotics navigation

Smart parking systems

Intrusion detection

IoT monitoring systems
